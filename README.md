# Marvel Rewatch App

This fullstack solution was designed to make quick and easy work of planning Marvel Cinematic Universe marathons.

The user can filter MCU entries by format (ie movies, shows, and extras), and by character; making it possible to quickly figure out the entire Bucky Barnes experience (the only experience worth having).

The API also makes a number of GET requests publicly available for accessing the raw data, and documentation for this is generated by Elysia's official Swagger plugin.

The frontend leverages the Tanstack suites of tools to full effect, and is built mostly from Shadcn UI components for speed and accessibility.

## Web API

[**Bun**](https://bun.sh/) -
This is the first project I've completed and published since jumping to Bun. It was a toss up between Bun and Deno, but Deno came with too many new concepts to learn and limitations to work around where Bun's promise of being a drop in replacement for Node delivers in full.

[**Elysia**](https://elysiajs.com/) -
With the jump to Bun I figured it would be a good time to try a new REST API framework while I was at it. Elysia emphasised DX and does a great job. Its first party plugins and integrations with other backend tools made me start to enjoy backend.

[**Drizzle ORM**](https://orm.drizzle.team/) -
I hate working with SQL, so Drizzle was a no brainer.

[**TursoDB**](https://turso.tech/) -
I've heard some bad things about Turso, but so far I have no complaints!

[**UploadThing**](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing) -
Starting the project I had a bunch of poster images as part of the repository, which wasn't going to scale. This file upload tool courtesy of [t3dotgg](https://github.com/t3dotgg) and co makes managing images a snap.

## Frontend

[**React (Vite)**](https://vite.dev/) -
If it ain't broke don't fix it. I just like React

[**Tanstack**](https://tanstack.com/) -
Tanner's tools are incredibly easy to use and made connecting the front and backend a lot simpler.
- Query
- Router
- Form

[**shadcn/ui**](https://ui.shadcn.com/) -
I didn't want to spend ages designing a frontend this time, as this project was meant to help improve my backend skills. Shadcn's components work great, look great, and feel great to use.
