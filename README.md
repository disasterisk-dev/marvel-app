# Marvel Rewatch App

This fullstack solution was designed to make quick and easy work of planning Marvel Cinematic Universe marathons.

The user can filter MCU entries by format (ie movies, shows, and extras), and by character; making it possible to quickly figure out the entire Bucky Barnes experience (the only experience worth having).

The API also makes a number of GET requests publicly available for accessing the raw data, and documentation for this is generated by Elysia's official Swagger plugin.

The frontend leverages the Tanstack suites of tools to full effect, and is built mostly from Shadcn UI components for speed and accessibility.
